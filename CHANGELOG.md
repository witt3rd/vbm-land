# Changelog

Interface (the stable part): the `land.conf` keys, the exit codes, the JSON last line, the hook names and the marker file names.
Additive changes to it are minor releases; anything else is major.

## Unreleased (0.2.0-dev)
- `bin/land-direct`: configurable lander (lock with lease, hold and freeze markers, land-time checks, regeneration of generated files, hooks, bounded steps, metrics log).
- `bin/land-red`: one red definition with the modes `push`, `push+dispatch`, `off`, an infrastructure classifier and the freeze marker.
- `scripts/bootstrap-land`: minimal lander, the recovery path.
- Test suite with a negative test per refusal.
